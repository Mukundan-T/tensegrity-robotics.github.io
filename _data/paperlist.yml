  abstract: "Mobile soft robots offer compelling applications in fields ranging from urban search and rescue to planetary exploration. A critical challenge of soft robotic control is that the nonlinear dynamics imposed by soft materials often result in complex behaviors that are counter-intuitive and hard to model or predict. As a consequence, most behaviors for mobile soft robots are discovered through empirical trial and error and handtuning. A second challenge is that soft materials are difficult to simulate with high fidelity - leading to a significant reality gap when trying to discover or optimize new behaviors. In this work we employ a Quality Diversity Algorithm running model-free on a physical soft tensegrity robot that autonomously generates a behavioral repertoire with no a priori knowledge of the robotâ€™s dynamics, and minimal human intervention. The resulting behavior repertoire displays a diversity of unique locomotive gaits useful for a variety of tasks. These results help provide a road map for increasing the behavioral capabilities of mobile soft robots through real-world automation."

  abstract: "Designing optimal soft modular robots is difficult, due to non-trivial interactions between morphology and controller. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots (TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT (ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when considering diversity in terms of 'illumination' of the feature space, DM-ME outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map."
